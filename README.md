# Random Password Generator

This is a demo Angular application, one of several in a series that I will publish as I acquire new Angular knowledge and skills.  

In this case it's a simple random password generator with options of password length, letters, numbers and symbols.  This is app runs 
as a  Single Page Application and can be seen in the wild at [https://random-pwd.herokuapp.com/](https://random-pwd.herokuapp.com/).  The repo has been updated to allow for automatic deployment from Github to Heroku, where the site is hosted for demo purposes.

Further details below regarding Angular specific instructions.

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 13.0.3.


# Angular Stuff

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via a platform of your choice. To use this command, you need to first add a package that implements end-to-end testing capabilities.
